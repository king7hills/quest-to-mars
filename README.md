# quest-to-mars
My entry for the levels.io vibe coded game challenge. Using a combo of Grok and Claude via Cursor to code the bulk of the game.

- at least 80% code has to be written by AI
- game has to be accessible on web without any login or signup and free-to-play (preferrably its own domain or subdomain)
- game does not need to be multiplayer, single player is fine, but multiplayer is nice too!
- can use any engine but usually ThreeJS is recommended
- NO loading screens and heavy downloads (!!!) has to be almost instantly in the game (except maybe ask username if you want)

Game Concept: Quest to Mars

Players begin as a primitive tribe and progress through stages of civilization, ultimately building a rocket to colonize Mars.
